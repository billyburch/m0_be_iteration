# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
* The `each` method seems especially practical when we want to take action on arrays that hold a large quantity of data types (one or multiple types, even). If I am looking for similar elements inside an array of 100 elements, I can readily find those by writing a sensible code block between my `do` and `end` keywords. *
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
* While I am very happy that my simple lines of code exectuted as I had hoped, I am curious if I am building my foundational understanding using best practices. I used the line of code `puts number if number > 10` into one of the practice challenges, and everything worked fine. All the while, I thought I need something more complicated (surely a curly bracket or a hash?!). *
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
* I did use a timer to avoid getting stuck too long without taking a break. Perhaps what I was most pleasantly surprised about was going with my intuition when I struggled to find the right answer on Google. Specifically, I just guessed that `string.reverse` might do exactly what I was hoping it did. Upon further digging, I discovered that `string.reverse!` will work too.
